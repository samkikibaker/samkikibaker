Hi, I’m Sam, a recent maths graduate and keen data scientist. As the work in my portfolio demonstrates, I can confidently manipulate, visualise and analyse messy data, presenting my findings in a concise format. With an ability to work solo or in a team, I’m also a great communicator and hard-working person.  

I’m actively looking for a graduate role in data science that will allow me to utilise and expand my knowledge of machine learning techniques. Please do not hesitate to contact me with any open positions.

For more information regarding my skills and experience please see my [CV]({{ site.baseurl }}/assets/CV.pdf)
